Why a simpler bird?

-Old one's too wide.

-Need to fit it into in box menu icon (KDE,MATE,XFCE,LXQT,etc.)

-And it's too detailed, despite being very simple(won't scale 
well to an tiny icon).

As for what it is? Why it's a rare bird called an bird of paradise.
Interesting things those are, there're closely related to crows.
There are two variants with an twin-tailed variant of their own, an
winged one and an wingless one.
